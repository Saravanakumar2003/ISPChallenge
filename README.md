# A convenient way to list service providers!

ISPHackerEarth a convenient way to list service providers!

## Problem Statement

Build a pseudo web application to list service providers and browse them.

## Minimum Requirement

- Use of Web API to fetch Data.

- DataSet Parameters: providers[7] -> (name, lowest_price, rating, max_speed, description, contact_no, email, image, url)

- Visually interactive responsive design listing all the providers.

- Use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  
- ReactJS is preferred but not mandatory. I have used ReactJS.


## Note
    
- The hackerearth platform API is not working. So, I have used a mockData to show the list of service providers.
- This website is still under development. I will add more features in the future.
